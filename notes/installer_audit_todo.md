## Detailed Task List

### 0. Growth / Differentiators Backlog (new beads)
- [ ] **ultimate_bug_scanner-ir4** – “Instant Confidence Onboarding”  
  - [x] Run `ubs doctor` automatically after install (opt-out flag).  
  - [x] Generate `~/.config/ubs/session.md` summary of install + doctor output.  
  - [ ] Enrich session summary with readiness facts (typos/ripgrep/t narrowing).  
  - [ ] Provide CLI command (`ubs sessions`) to tail/format summaries.  
  - [ ] Surface next-action prompts if doctor finds missing deps.
- [ ] **ultimate_bug_scanner-4se** – “Type Narrowing Full Coverage”  
  - [x] Kotlin smart-cast & Elvis heuristics (null-safe + guard reasoning).  
  - [x] Swift guard-let helper + Java wiring.  
  - [ ] Extend Swift coverage (optional chaining, Objective-C bridging misuse).  
  - [ ] Add fixtures + manifest rows for Kotlin coroutine/Swift optional cases.  
  - [ ] Doc updates for Swift/Kotlin guard rules, CLI flag references.
- [x] **ultimate_bug_scanner-4sm** – “Resource Lifecycle Packs”  
  - [x] Python: context managers / file/socket close symmetry.  
  - [x] Go: `defer` pairing for files, db handles, mutexes.  
  - [x] Java: try-with-resources coverage (auto-closeable).  
  - [x] Publish pack toggle (`--category resource-lifecycle`).  
  - [x] Manifest coverage per language.
- [x] **ultimate_bug_scanner-1nr** – “Shareable Reports”  
  - [x] HTML report preview (diff vs previous run).  
  - [x] SARIF enhancements with run comparison metadata.  
  - [x] Embed GitHub file:line permalinks in JSON/text output.  
  - [x] CLI flag for “comparison mode” (baseline file).
- [ ] **ultimate_bug_scanner-k2r** – “Developer Happiness Set”  
  - [ ] `ubs configure` wizard for `.ubsignore`, default languages, env settings.  
  - [ ] Optional “fix suggestion” snippets per category (text + JSON).  
  - [ ] Alias helper to pipe findings into AI prompts.
- [ ] **ultimate_bug_scanner-m5n** – “Visibility & Trust”  
  - [ ] Blog-series pipeline (“UBS Hall of Bugs”) with anonymized story template.  
  - [ ] Publish metrics dashboard (installs, average scan time, top findings).  
  - [ ] README badge hooking into metric snapshot.

### 1. TypeScript Fixtures & Manifest (46h)
- [x] Re-read new TS fixtures (buggy/clean) for correctness + clarity (verified guard/exit semantics on 2025-11-17).
- [x] Confirm manifest entries assert expected counts for new category (js-type-narrowing cases pass via `uv run`).
- [x] Update `test-suite/README.md` fixtures + expected output table (documented TS + cross-language rows).
- [x] Document CLI flag/manifest guidance in `README.md` or dedicated section (README already covers `--skip-type-narrowing`; sanity checked).

### 2. Installer + CLI Skip Flag (dit)
- [x] Audit CLI `--skip-type-narrowing` plumbing (env var, config, help text) end-to-end (config + help updated 2025-11-17).
- [x] Ensure installer + diagnostics honor skip flag (TypeScript readiness logging no longer trips `set -e`).
- [x] Extend installer dry-run/logging coverage for new routines. *(npm install helper + readiness block respect dry-run.)*
- [x] Add `--self-test` follow-up coverage (installer harness now runs a dedicated `--self-test` regression unless invoked recursively).
- [x] Refresh README/INSTALL docs for diagnostics + skip flag usage (README safety-net/table updated with Node/TypeScript note).

### 3. Cross-language Heuristics (8d7)
- [x] Validate new Rust helper + fixtures; ensure manifest/test coverage (helper handles single files; JS/Rust cases pass via `uv run`).
- [x] Investigate Kotlin (or other language) heuristic feasibility + design plan.
- [x] Hook optional rules into CLI config/flags (parallel to TS case).
- [x] Update docs to mention multi-language coverage & how to toggle.
- [x] Evaluate migrating the Rust helper to ast-grep rules (Bash wrapper now collects ast-grep JSON and feeds the helper, with regex fallback when ast-grep/python unavailable).

### 4. Typos Spellchecker Integration
- [x] Confirm `install_typos` handles macOS/Linux/Windows, dry-run, retries (binary download + brew/cargo paths verified).
- [x] Add detection logic + diagnostics (installer + verification now report Typos status/skips).
- [x] Provide `--skip-typos` flag/config + documentation (README safety-net table + flag wiring updated).
- [x] Extend smoke tests to exercise Typos install/skip paths (installer harness updated with regression coverage).

### 5. Installer Reliability + UX
- [x] Review locking/tempfile helpers (self-test releases locks; harness ensures no stray `/tmp/ubs-install.lock`).
- [x] Ensure cleanup only deletes tracked temp paths; add coverage in tests. *(WORKDIR override + safe removal guard + harness asserts workdir cleanup.)*
- [x] Polish log formatting + section headings (consistent emojis/colors?). *(log_section now prints framed titles.)*
- [x] Improve `install.sh --help` text (options grouped, new flags described).
- [x] Add PATH shadow warning and summary reminder (post-install `warn_if_stale_binary` now runs; consider further summary polish).

### 6. Test Coverage & Tooling
- [x] Fix `test-suite/install/run_tests.sh` to accommodate new diagnostics + Typos (captures exit code + tolerates readiness probe).
- [x] Run entire install test suite locally (CI parity) and capture output (`bash test-suite/install/run_tests.sh`).
- [x] Execute UBS manifest or targeted tests for new fixtures (JS/Rust type narrowing cases run via `uv`).
- [x] Run `ubs .` (or scoped) after code changes per AGENTS.md. *(./ubs --ci . run 2025-11-18; warnings 0 after async helper + JSON heuristics refinements.)*

### 7. Fresh-Eyes Review & Follow-ups
- [x] Re-read modified installer + module code for obvious bugs/regressions.
- [ ] File new beads for any follow-up work discovered mid-review.
- [ ] Summarize findings + scanner results in final handoff.

### 8. Instant Confidence Onboarding (ir4)
- [x] Capture readiness facts (ripgrep/jq/typos/type narrowing) during installer run and feed into session summary bullet list.
- [x] Include last `ubs doctor` exit status + pointer to session log path in completion banner.
- [x] Implement `ubs sessions` (or `ubs session-log`) subcommand:
  - [x] Show tail of `~/.config/ubs/session.md` with optional `--entries`/`--raw` flags.
  - [x] Respect `NO_COLOR` and provide helpful error if log absent.
- [x] Installer: mention new CLI command in quickstart text + README.
- [x] Test: extend `test-suite/install/run_tests.sh` to stub HOME, run installer with `--skip-doctor` false, then assert `ubs sessions --entries 1` prints latest block without error (maybe by invoking CLI script with env pointing to temp config).

### 9. Type Narrowing Full Coverage (4se)
- [x] Kotlin helper: add coroutine/optional-chain awareness (e.g., guard `if (job?.isActive == true)` before `job!!`).
- [x] Swift helper: detect optional chaining misuse (guard `if foo?.bar != nil` then later `foo!.bar`), and bridging cases.
- [x] Add fixtures under `test-suite/kotlin/type_narrowing/` and `test-suite/swift/type_narrowing/` for new heuristics; update manifest counts accordingly.
- [x] README/test-suite docs: new Swift/Kotlin coverage table row plus CLI flag mention.
- [x] UBS CLI help text: mention cross-language coverage + `--skip-type-narrowing` effects (ensuring help section includes languages).
- [x] Tests: run targeted manifest cases + `test-suite/run_all.sh` to verify metrics.
